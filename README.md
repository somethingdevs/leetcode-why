# Welcome to Leetcode-why üöÄ

Before reading any of this. Yes I yeeted it off ChatGPT. 

Ever find yourself staring at a LeetCode problem like it just asked you the
square root of a cheeseburger? Yeah, me too. This repository is my digital
breadcrumb trail through the forest of coding challenges‚Äîbecause sometimes, we
all need to remember how we escaped the wolves last time.

## What's Inside? üßê

Solutions: A mix of smart, dumb, and "why didn't I think of that before" answers
to LeetCode problems. Mostly written while under the influence of too much
caffeine and not enough sleep.

Explanations: Like reading a bedtime story, but instead of princes and dragons,
it's algorithms and data structures. I try to explain the why behind each
solution, in terms I'd understand at 2 AM.

Tears and Triumphs: The coding journey is full of ups and downs. Mostly downs,
if we're being honest. But hey, the things I do for money, right? :')

Why "Leetcode-why"? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

- Because "LeetCode-please-stop-making-me-feel-dumb" was too long for a repository name. 
- Also, because asking "why" gets to the heart of learning. 
- Why does this solution work? Why did I think using recursion here was a good idea? And most importantly, 
- Why am I doing this to myself? For money, obviously. And maybe, just maybe, for the love of code.

## Who Is This For? üëÄ

My Future Self: When future me wonders how past me solved that impossible
problem, here's the proof I did it once.

Fellow Sufferers: Anyone who's ever looked at a LeetCode problem and thought, "I
too like to live dangerously." 

The Curious: Those who wonder why anyone would
subject themselves to this kind of torture. 

Spoiler: it's for the sweet, sweet payoff (we hope). 

## Dive In üèä 

Whether you're here to learn, laugh, or see someone else suffer through the same problems you're tackling, welcome aboard. Let's decode these mysteries together, one line of code and one facepalm at a time.

Happy coding, and may the odds be ever in your favor (because sometimes, it sure
doesn't feel like it).
