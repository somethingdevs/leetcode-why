## 876. Remove duplicates from LinkedList

### Main idea - Simple Linked List traversal

#### Reasoning

1. Check if there is one or two elements in the list and deal with it
2. Initialize a node that can traverse the list
3. While loop until the next is not null
4. If next is the same value as the current, then route it to the next one
5. Else just let it continue
